    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>Whiplash (2014), directed by Damien Chazelle, is an intense drama about ambition, obsession, and the pursuit of greatness. The film follows Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller), a talented young jazz drummer enrolled at a prestigious music conservatory. Andrew’s dream is to become one of the greatest drummers of all time, and he’s willing to sacrifice anything to achieve it.</p>
    <p>Andrew’s life changes when he is noticed by Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), a fearsome and demanding instructor who leads the school’s elite jazz band. Fletcher is notorious for his brutal teaching methods, pushing his students beyond their limits, often using fear, humiliation, and emotional abuse to drive them toward perfection. He believes that greatness can only be achieved through extreme pressure.</p>
    <p>Under Fletcher’s ruthless guidance, Andrew becomes increasingly obsessed with mastering his craft. He pushes himself to physical and emotional extremes, practicing until his hands bleed, neglecting relationships, and spiraling into a destructive quest for approval. The relationship between Andrew and Fletcher becomes a psychological battle, with Andrew seeking validation and Fletcher constantly testing his limits.</p>
    <p>The film culminates in a climactic performance where Andrew’s determination and Fletcher’s manipulative tactics collide, resulting in a powerful final confrontation on stage. Whiplash explores the fine line between excellence and obsession, questioning how far one should go in the pursuit of perfection and what it costs on a personal level.</p>
