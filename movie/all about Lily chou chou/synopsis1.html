    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>All About Lily Chou-Chou (2001), directed by Shunji Iwai, is a Japanese drama that delves into the lives of disillusioned teenagers navigating isolation, trauma, and violence in a modern, alienating world. The film centers around Yuichi, a sensitive and introverted boy, and his deep obsession with an enigmatic pop singer, Lily Chou-Chou, whose ethereal music serves as a refuge for him and other fans in an online forum called “Lilyphilia.”</p>
    <p>Yuichi’s world outside the forum is far bleaker. His friendship with Hoshino, once a model student, deteriorates after Hoshino's transformation into a cruel, manipulative bully. The film portrays the disintegration of youthful innocence, showing how the harshness of reality—bullying, betrayal, and abuse—crushes the spirits of the characters. The beauty of Lily Chou-Chou’s music contrasts with the bleakness of their everyday lives, symbolizing a longing for escape.</p>
    <p>The film is nonlinear and fragmented, blending cyberculture, music, and brutal realism. It poignantly captures the disconnection and struggles of adolescence in a hypermodern society.</p>
