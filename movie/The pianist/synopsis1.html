    <h2>Synopsis:</h2>
    <p>The Pianist (2002), directed by Roman Polanski, is a biographical war drama based on the memoir of Władysław Szpilman, a Jewish-Polish pianist, and his survival during World War II. The film stars Adrien Brody as Szpilman and chronicles his harrowing experiences during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw.</p>
    <p>The story begins in 1939, when Szpilman is a celebrated pianist living in Warsaw. His life, along with those of his family and the entire Jewish population, is upended when the Germans invade Poland. Szpilman and his family are forced into the Warsaw Ghetto, where they suffer from hunger, oppression, and fear. As the Nazis begin deporting Jews to concentration camps, Szpilman is separated from his family and narrowly escapes. From that point on, he spends the war hiding in the ruins of Warsaw, enduring isolation, starvation, and constant danger.</p>
    <p>Despite his circumstances, Szpilman survives with the help of a few sympathetic people, including a German officer who discovers him near the war’s end but chooses to spare his life. Throughout the film, Szpilman’s connection to music remains his source of hope, even as he endures the unimaginable horrors of the Holocaust.</p>
    <p>The film is a powerful portrayal of resilience, survival, and the human spirit in the face of overwhelming tragedy. It won several Academy Awards, including Best Director for Polanski and Best Actor for Brody.</p>
